Introduction
This project is a Movie Recommendation System that provides movie recommendations based on user input. It uses a deep learning model for recommendations, along with data visualizations to analyze movie trends and industry patterns.
Features
•	Predicts movies based on genre, year, director, and ratings.
•	Provides reasons for each recommendation (e.g., genre overlap, same director, etc.).
•	Displays analysis on top genres, directors, and revenue trends.
•	Interactive web interface built with Flask.
Technologies Used
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Web Framework: Flask
•	Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow/Keras
•	Data Analysis and Visualization: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
•	Frontend: HTML, CSS
•	Data Preprocessing: Scikit-learn
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
•	Python 3.7 or above
•	Libraries: TensorFlow, Flask, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Steps
1.	Download all the files for this project into a single folder on your computer
2.	Open the visual studio code with the folder contents in separate workspace
3.	cd <foldername> in terminal
4.	Install dependencies: 
5.	pip install -r requirements.txt
6.	Place the dataset file (final_final_dataset.csv) in the project directory.
7.	Run the Flask app: 
8.	python app.py
9.	Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
Dataset
The project uses a movie dataset containing columns like:
•	movie: Movie title
•	director: Director of the movie
•	genres: Movie genres (pipe-separated)
•	year: Release year
•	rating: IMDb or other ratings
•	revenue: Revenue generated
•	overview: Short description of the movie
•	duration: Length of the movie
Dataset Preprocessing:
•	Missing values are dropped.
•	Categorical columns like movie, genres, and director are encoded using LabelEncoder.
•	Genres are split into lists for calculating overlaps.

Model Overview
The recommendation model is built using Matrix Factorization with embeddings:
•	Inputs: Encoded movie and genre indices.
•	Embeddings: 
o	Movies: 50-dimensional
o	Genres: 10-dimensional
•	Dense Layers: 
o	64 hidden units with ReLU activation
o	Final output layer predicts movie ratings.
The model is trained for 10 epochs using mean_squared_error loss and the Adam optimizer.

Architecture
Components
Data Preprocessing: Cleans, integrates, and encodes metadata (genres, directors, ratings, revenue).

Content-Based Filtering (CBF): Uses similarity (TF-IDF + cosine similarity) on movie metadata.

Collaborative Filtering (CF): Matrix factorization with embeddings to capture hidden user–movie interactions.

Hybrid Engine: Combines results of CBF and CF for robust recommendations.

Analytics Module: Provides visual insights (genre distribution, revenue trends, director performance).

Flask Web App: Interactive user interface for recommendations.

Application Workflow
1.	User enters a movie title on the homepage.
2.	The app fetches the movie's attributes (e.g., genres, director).
3.	The model predicts ratings for all other movies.
4.	Recommendations are filtered based on: 
o	Genre overlap
o	Same director or year
o	High ratings
5.	Recommended movies are displayed with details and reasons.

File Descriptions
1. app.py
•	Main Flask application file.
•	Contains routes for the homepage (/) and recommendation logic (/recommend).
•	Defines the recommendation logic and uses the trained model for predictions.
2. analysis.py
•	Contains data analysis and visualization scripts.
•	Generates insights like: 
o	Genre frequency distribution.
o	Revenue trends by genre and director.
o	Yearly performance of movies.
o	Correlation between ratings and revenue.
3. templates/
•	index.html: Homepage with a search bar for entering movie titles.
•	recommendation.html: Displays movie recommendations.
•	error.html: Error page when no recommendations are found.
4. static/
•	images and other static assets used by the web application.
5. final_final_dataset.csv
•	Dataset file used for training and analysis.
Usage
1.	Run the Flask app using: 
2.	python app.py
3.	Enter a movie name in the search bar.
4.	View recommendations with reasons in the results page.

Analysis & Visualizations
1. Genre Frequency Distribution

2. Average Revenue by Genre

3. Director Success by Revenue

4. Year-wise Trends (Ratings & Revenue)

5. Correlation Heatmap

6. Impact of Duration on Ratings

Future Enhancements
•	Integrate user-based and item-based collaborative filtering.
•	Allow users to rate recommendations for improved personalization.
•	Extend the analysis to include actor-level insights.
•	Add more advanced NLP-based techniques to analyze movie overviews.
